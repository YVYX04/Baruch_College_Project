### Overview of the Certificate

The Baruch College C++ Programming for Financial Engineering Certificate, offered in collaboration with QuantNet, is one of the most recognized technical training programs in quantitative finance.
It focuses on modern C++ and its applications in computational finance, combining rigorous theoretical foundations with hands-on programming assignments inspired by real-world financial engineering problems.

Throughout the program, participants master advanced C++ features (templates, STL, smart pointers, inheritance, Boost Libraries, etc.), numerical methods (Monte Carlo simulation, finite differences, PDE solvers), and object-oriented design patterns used in the quant industry.

### Foreword on This Repository

This repository contains my final project, which consolidates key concepts learned during the certificate.
It showcases the implementation of computational finance models using modern C++ design principles.

### Outcome

I am happy to say that I obtained the **C++ Programming for Financial Engineering** Certificate from Baruch College with distinction (94/100)
on November 29 2025.
