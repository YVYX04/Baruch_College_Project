### Overview of the Certificate

The Baruch College C++ Programming for Financial Engineering Certificate, offered in collaboration with QuantNet, is one of the most recognized technical training programs in quantitative finance.
It focuses on modern C++ and its applications in computational finance, combining rigorous theoretical foundations with hands-on programming assignments inspired by real-world financial engineering problems.

Throughout the program, participants master advanced C++ features (templates, STL, smart pointers, inheritance, Boost Libraries, etc.), numerical methods (Monte Carlo simulation, finite differences, PDE solvers), and object-oriented design patterns used in the quant industry.
